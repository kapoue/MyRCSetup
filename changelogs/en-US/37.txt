🐛 Critical Fix v1.8.1

URGENT CORRECTION:
- Fixed GitHub API URL for update detection
- Corrected GitHub username (kapouik → kapoue)
- Resolved HTTP 404 error when checking for updates

This version fixes a critical bug that completely prevented the automatic update detection feature introduced in v1.8.0 from working.

All other features remain unchanged.
